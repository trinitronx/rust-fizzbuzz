# FizzBuzz Code Golf

Consider the following problem:

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

- For each multiple of 3, print "`Fizz`" instead of the number.
- For each multiple of 5, print "`Buzz`" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "`FizzBuzz`" instead of the number.
- Write a solution (or reduce an existing one) so it has as few characters as possible.

Scoring

- Your score is: `200 - number of characters in your source code) / 100`
